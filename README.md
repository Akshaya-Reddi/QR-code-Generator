# QR-code-Generator
A python script which can generate QR code with a link

# Important note
You can call your file any name except qrcode.py. This is because qrcode.py is a file that already exists as part of the qrcode library that we will use, and calling your file that will overwrite the library functions.

# Explanation
1.The qrcode library: This library lets us perform all of our QR code related operations.

2.The pillow library: This library helps us process and save images.

3.The version parameter is an integer from 1 to 40 that controls the size of the QR code.

4.The box_size parameter controls how many pixels each “box” of the QR code is.

5.The border parameter controls how many boxes thick the border should be.

# Final Output
At last you should see the youtube_qr.png image pop up on the left-hand side of VS Code, and you can open it to see what it looks like. I also uploaded the qr code in this repository.
